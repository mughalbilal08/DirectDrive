DirectDrive - Smart Ride Assignment System
DirectDrive is a ride-hailing web application developed using PHP and MySQL that aims to improve the traditional ride-booking model through relationship-focused driver assignments and a flexible subscription system. The platform supports three types of users: Admins, Drivers, and Customers. Each user has specific roles and permissions to ensure smooth operation and enhanced accountability.

The Admin plays a central role by approving driver registrations, assigning drivers to specific customers to foster trust and long-term relationships, and reviewing detailed ride reports submitted by drivers—especially those involving rides taken outside the system. This feature enhances safety and provides a mechanism for oversight in case any issues arise. Admins are also responsible for managing subscription approvals after reviewing payment receipts uploaded by drivers.

Drivers can register themselves on the platform but require approval from the admin before accessing system features. Once approved, drivers can accept ride requests based on their subscription tier. In the basic tier, drivers are limited to rides assigned directly by the admin. With a premium subscription, they are allowed to take on any available ride. After subscribing, drivers upload a payment receipt which must be approved by the admin to activate premium privileges.

Customers can also self-register and request rides from available drivers. Customers using the basic tier can only request immediate rides. However, premium customers have the added benefit of being able to pre-book rides for future dates, offering greater flexibility and convenience.

The subscription model adds an extra layer of control and monetization to the system. It enables the platform to restrict or extend access based on the user’s tier and ensures accountability through admin review and approval processes.

DirectDrive includes all core functionalities such as user registration, login, role-based access control, ride management, ride reporting, and subscription processing.

This project was developed collaboratively by a team of six members and is version-controlled using GitHub. The system uses a modular structure and follows best practices in code organization, error handling, and user interface design. It is designed to be scalable and easily deployable on local development environments such as XAMPP or Laragon.
